# e-commerce-shop
A fake e-commerce shop created with django (backend) and react (frontend).

Goal of this project was to demonstrate some essential frontend skills 
and implement classic functionalites that can be found on a typical e-commerce website.

As the design was not the primary concern, the site does not behave in a responsive way yet. 
Nethertheless, the site includes the use of a self-made backend/REST api which serves it's purpose, 
but still requires a lot of optimizations to be made.

The page includes things like filtering, routing, asynchronous data fetching, local storage writing & reading, search, etc.
Also components like the caroussel effect are self-written.
